AI-Based Number Guessing Game
Overview

The AI-Based Number Guessing System is an intelligent Python program that attempts to guess a number selected by the user. Using the binary search algorithm, the AI efficiently narrows down possible choices based on user feedback, ensuring quick and optimal guessing.

ðŸš€ Features

âœ… AI-Powered Guessing â€“ Uses a binary search algorithm to minimize attempts.âœ… Interactive Feedback System â€“ User provides hints ('h' for higher, 'l' for lower, 'c' for correct).âœ… Efficient Search Strategy â€“ Finds the number in the least possible attempts.âœ… Customizable Range â€“ Allows users to set their own range of numbers.âœ… Replay Option â€“ Play multiple rounds without restarting the program.
How It Works:

The user thinks of a number within a predefined or user-specified range.

The AI makes an initial guess (typically the middle value of the range).

The user provides feedback:

'h' â†’ The number is higher than the AI's guess.

'l' â†’ The number is lower than the AI's guess.

'c' â†’ The AI guessed correctly.

The AI adjusts its range based on the user's feedback and continues guessing until it finds the correct number.

The AI displays the number of attempts taken.
